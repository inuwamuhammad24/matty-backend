## GENERAL PROGRAM INFORMATION

#### 2.5.1 HISTORY OF THE PHYSICS DEPARTMENT
Physics, originally called 'natural philosophy', included the study of the whole of nature. Today the subject is described as the study of the properties of matter and energy under such traditional branches as mechanics, properties of matter, heat and thermodynamics, light, sound, electricity and magnetism, atomic, nuclear and molecular Physics, geophysics, atmospheric physics, environmental physics, biophysics and meteorology. The tremendous and far reaching development implications of the theory of Relativity and Quantum theory of the 20th century have given a modern perspective to the subject. Today the science of physics has assumed a greater importance than ever on account of its unprecedented advance in experimental techniques, its industrial applications and the influence of its ideas on contemporary thought.

The B.Sc. Honours in Physics is an **eight semester full-time course**, currently with industrial training designed to give students a broad understanding and a wide spectrum of knowledge. The mathematical foundation and relevant courses run throughout the four years in both Mathematics and Physics Departments. Other required courses are taken from Chemistry, Computer Science, and General Studies in the first two years. There are options for specialized courses in the **third and fourth years** by choosing from Electronics/Communication, Biophysics, Atmospheric Physics and Geophysics. At the final year the student is expected to carry out **theoretical or experimental research** on a selected topic under the supervision of academic staff.

**(a) PHILOSOPHY OF THE PHYSICS DEPARTMENT**
The philosophy of Physics as a discipline is involved in the objective investigation of the interactions of the forces of nature with matter. These investigations are basically empirical and experimental in approach and serve as confirmation of, or lead to new, theoretical formulation in a mutually reciprocal relationship. Our Curriculum is therefore biased towards the **experimental and applied studies**; based on a sound theoretical background.

**(b) GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE  PHYSICS DEPARTMENT**
The goal of the Physics course at the University of Jos is to produce graduates grounded in the **basic theories of Physics, experimental techniques and theory applications**. It is our goal to prepare our graduates for a career in either research and development and or teaching or for entry into some specific technological profession. In the various courses of study, therefore, we aim at imparting an appreciation of current problems, modern techniques and trends in Physics.

By the end of the course, students should have acquired the following:
i) At least a good understanding of the theoretical principles of Physics as contained in the NUC Minimum Academic Standard Curriculum for Physics.
ii) An appreciation of the current problems, modern techniques and trends in Physics and
iii) A familiarization of the required manipulative skills of the equipment in a Physics Laboratory.
iv) The competencies and skills to function effectively in the academia, public and private sectors.

#### 2.5 RELEVANCE OF THE PROGRAMME
The Physics programme has remained relevant in:
i) Developing the mind and intellect of the individual
ii) Training in the basics of the Physical Sciences
iii) Training in the specialized areas of Physics i.e. Atmospheric Physics, Medical & Biophysics, Electronics & Communications, Acoustics, Geophysics, enabling graduates to fit into the Medical sector, Engineering & Technology, Meterology and Communications.
