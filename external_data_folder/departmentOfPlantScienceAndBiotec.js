## GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF PLANT SCIENCE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY

### A. INTRODUCTION
Like most Departments in the Faculties of Arts, Education, and Natural Sciences, the Department of Plant Science and Biotechnology (then called Department of Botany and later Plant Science and Technology, and now Plant Science and Biotechnology), started as an off-shoot of the Parent Department at the University of Ibadan. The Degree Programme was introduced early in 1974 at the Murtala Mohammed Way Campus within the Jos township.

The initial lecturers usually came on secondment for brief periods from the Parent University as Part-Time Visiting Lecturers. However, by October 1974, Drs. C.O. Akueshi, V. S. A. Odunfa, and I. O. Fasidi were sent to Jos as permanent staff of the Jos Campus of the University of Ibadan. Along with them came Professor B. A. Oso, a Senior Staff member of the Department of Botany, University of Ibadan, who was requested to proceed to Jos on Secondment for the 1974/75 session as the Resident Administrator to oversee the running of the Young Department.

During the 1975/76 session, Professor Ayandele (the then Principal of Jos Campus of the University of Ibadan) appointed Dr. C. O. Akueshi as the Coordinator of the Botany Department. Also, in 1975 the then Military Government announced the establishment of seven new Universities, and Jos Campus of the University of Ibadan thus became an autonomous University of Jos.

With this nucleus staff, the department started its **undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in 1976/77 and 1978/79 sessions** respectively. The Department produced the **first batch of Undergraduates and Postgraduates in 1979**. Prof. T. O. S. Popoola and Mr. K. J. Osaji were among the first products of the Department.

Professor G. K. Berrie was appointed the first substantive Head of the autonomous Department of Plant Science and Technology (then Botany).

The Department dropped its former name **Botany**, to assume the new name; **Department of Plant Science and Technology** and recently **Department of Plant Science and Biotechnology**, following the expansion of programmes in line with the current advancement in the World of Technology.

## B. PHILOSOPHY, AIM AND OBJECTIVES

### PHILOSOPHY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PLANT SCIENCE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
The Department of Plant Science & Biotechnology is envisioned to deliver a **comprehensive understanding of the concept of Plant science and Biotechnology** through the usage of both theoretical and practical skills in **resolving national problems**. The programme is organised to elaborate the significance of Plant science and Biotechnology in industry, agriculture, health and environmental sectors of the society. The programme is also designed to equip undergraduates with sound knowledge in Plant science by using some basic tools of Biotechnology. The Department hopes to produce graduates with **knowledge-based skill sets** relevant to research institutes, industries, agriculture, health sectors, and to inculcate in students the **entrepreneurial and problem-resolving ability** towards national development. It also provides sufficient knowledge-based theoretical principles that would enable prospective graduates to undertake postgraduate study in Plant science and Biotechnology and other related fields.

### C. AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PLANT SCIENCE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
The Aims of the programme are to:
1.  Equip the Undergraduate Students with a **sound knowledge of the fundamental principles and modern biotechnological methods** involved in the study of plants and plant products.
2.  Equip our graduates for **gainful employment** in the diverse fields of plant biology and biotechnology such as agriculture, plant breeding, genetic engineering, forestry, horticulture, pharmacology, pharmacy, medicine, microbiology, criminology, environmental management, geology, information technology and even statistics.
3.  Equip our students with **entrepreneurial skills** for productive safe employment, research and nation building in the areas of plant resource utilization and biotechnology.

The specific objectives of the course are to:
* Provide foundation training in the basic knowledge and skills in **plant biology and plant bio-resource utilization**.
* Teach the application of good and **modern scientific techniques and methods** applicable to the fields of biotechnology.
* Inculcate through teaching and research an in-depth knowledge of the unique crops characteristics of the Jos Plateau (such as 'achas' (Digitaria exillis L.), Irish Potato (Solanum tubersum L.), Mangu bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), Rizga (Plectranthus esculentus), etc).
* Produce graduates with skills and techniques that will make them **potential managers of nature resources**.
* Train students who will **contribute to the economy of Nigeria** through the knowledge of plant biology and biotechnology.

## E. GRADUATION REQUIREMENT & GRADING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PLANT SCIENCE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY

### GRADUATION REQUIREMENT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PLANT SCIENCE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
To be eligible for the award of the degree of **B. Sc Plant Science and Biotechnology**, a student shall pass a minimum of **120 credit units** (for a four-year degree programme), or **90 credits** (in the case of a Direct Entry student), including all compulsory courses.

### EVALUATION AND GRADING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PLANT SCIENCE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
The evaluation of a student's performance is done on the basis of marks scored in the final examination and his continuous assessment.
* The continuous assessment is given a weighting of **30%**.
* The final examination has a weighting of **70%**.
* The **minimum pass mark is 40%**.
* A student who fails the course is allowed to register for the course again and take the examination when next it is offered.

| Percentage Score | Letter Grade | Grade Point | Remark |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 70 - 100 | A | 5 | Pass |
| 60 - 69 | B | 4 | Pass |
| 50 - 59 | C | 3 | Pass |
| 45 - 49 | D | 2 | Pass |
| 0 - 44 | E | 1 | Fail |

The class of degree of a graduating student is determined as follows:

## F. COURSE CONTENT (B.Sc. HONOURS IN PLANT SCIENCE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY)

This is a **four-year full-time programme** with a supervised **6-month industrial training period** (SIWES). It is designed to give students a broad knowledge of biological and technological concepts, with the expected specialization in the fourth year after a major project carried out by each student. The broad lines of studies followed are eighteen: General Biology, Botany, Biotechnology, Chemistry, Industrial Microbiology, Biotechnology, Zoology, Biomedical subjects, Environmental Science, Geology, Mathematics, Physic, Statistics, Computer Science, Horticulture, Plant Breeding, Tissue Culture and General Studies.

* **First and second years:** Lay the foundation for the remaining two years which consolidate the knowledge of the relevant Physical Sciences and Computer Technology.
* **Third year:** Continues and extends the eighteen subject areas. This is followed by a six-month period of Students' Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES).
* **Fourth year:** Students specialize by choosing from a variety of theoretical and practical options. In addition, students carry out an in-depth research project and special literature exercises on selected research topics.
* A **field course** is held during each year of study.
