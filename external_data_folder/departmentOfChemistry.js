## RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT

### Minimum Requirements for Continuation in Programme
The current applicable regulation requires all students to maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of **1.0 each year** to remain in the programme. A **CGPA below 1.0** places the student automatically on **academic probation for one year**. Failure to improve on the CGPA within the next academic year earns the student an **automatic withdrawal** from the department. Such a student will be allowed to transfer to other programmes within the University.

### Attendance Requirements for Lectures, Practical and Tutorials for the department of chemistry
The presently accepted **minimum attendance is 75%**. If a student must be absent for unavoidable reasons, they should inform the course lecturer.

### Excuse Duty Requirement for the department of chemistry
All circumstances (e.g. ill-health, hospitalization, emergency calls, etc.) that prevent a student from attending lectures, practical/tutorials or writing prescribed tests and examinations, require **excuse duty certification from the University Health Centre**. Medical certificates of ill-health obtained elsewhere must still be certified by the Health Centre to be acceptable.

### Channel of Communication for the department of chemistry
Any problems requiring Departmental, Faculty, or University Administration attention must first be communicated **in writing** (after a prior discussion with the academic adviser) to the **Head of Department**, who will determine the appropriate level for handling the matter.

### CALCULATION OF GPA AND CGPA
| Acronym | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **TCR** | Total credit units registered for each session |
| **CTCR** | Cumulative total credit units registered for 2 or more sessions |
| **CU** | Credit units of each course |
| **GP** | Grade point of each course earned (e.g., A=5, B=4, C=3) |
| **TGP** | Total grade points earned for each session |
| **CTGP** | Cumulative total grade point for 2 or more sessions |
| **GPA** | Grade point average for each session |
| **CGPA** | Cumulative grade point average for 2 or more sessions |

**Formulas:**
1.  **TGP = ∑(CU × GP)**
2.  **GPA = TGP / TCR**
3.  **CGPA (For 2 or more sessions) = CTGP / CTCR**

### Staff Promotion and Development for the department of chemistry
* **Staff development** processes include: Training of employed graduate assistants, in-service training of lecturers and technical staff, and teaching/research experience.
* **Staff promotion** is handled sequentially by the Departmental Appraisal Committee, Faculty Appraisal Committee, Complex Appraisal Committee, and the Central Appraisal Committee.

### Examinations and Moderation for the department of chemistry
* **Setting:** Lecturers who taught the courses set the questions.
* **Conduct:** The department uses a **semester system** where examinations are administered at the end of each course/semester in accordance with approved regulations.
* **Moderation:** 100L - 300L questions are moderated internally, while 400 level degree examination questions are moderated by **external examiners** appointed by the University.
* **Issuance of Results:** Programme semester results are approved by the Department Board of Examiners, followed by the Faculty Board and finally the University Senate before release.

### Student Welfare for the department of chemistry
* **Academic Grievances:** Handled through the Department and Faculty student-staff forum, as well as by the Departmental staff-students Committee.
* **Student Academic Adviser:** All students are assigned to an academic adviser.
* **Staff/Student Forum:** A gathering held frequently at the beginning of the academic session where students can air views and issues are collectively examined for solutions.
