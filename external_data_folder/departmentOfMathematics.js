### SECTION A: GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS

---

## HISTORY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS
The Department of Mathematics at the University of Jos started as an offshoot of the parent Department of Mathematics at the University of Ibadan in 1974, when there was a Jos Campus of the University of Ibadan. This campus eventually became the University of Jos.

The Mathematics undergraduate programme started in the **1976/77 session** and the postgraduate programme two years later, in the **1978/79 session**. The current Head of Department is Dr J.N. Ndam.

The Department currently has **twenty-eight (28) academic staff** including seven at professorial level. Research activities are mainly in the areas of **Algebra, Complex Analysis, Numerical Analysis, Biomathematics/Mathematical modelling, Control Theory and Statistics**.

Currently, the Department offers undergraduate degrees in **Mathematics and Statistics**. Postgraduate degrees are offered at the masters and doctoral levels in **Mathematics only**. The Department also has an approved **Postgraduate Diploma programme in Statistics**.

## PHILOSOPHY AND OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAMMES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS

The philosophy of the programmes is to give students the opportunity to obtain broad knowledge in the theory and applications of **Mathematics/Statistics** that prepares them for careers as practising Mathematicians/Statisticians.

### Objectives
1. To provide students with a broad and balanced foundation in the knowledge and practical skills in Mathematics/Statistics.
2. To develop in students the ability to apply their knowledge and skills to the solutions of theoretical and practical problems in Mathematics/Statistics.
3. To develop in students a range of transferable skills of value in Mathematical or Statistical related and other employment.
4. To provide students with knowledge and skills-base from which they proceed to further studies in specialised areas of Mathematics or Statistics or multidisciplinary areas involving Mathematics/Statistics.
5. To generate in students an appreciation of the importance of Mathematics/Statistics in an industrial, economic, environmental and social context.
6. To produce graduates who will be job creators through consultancy services in related areas of Mathematics or Statistical data analysis.
