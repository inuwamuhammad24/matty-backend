## STUDENT ADVISERS AND COORDINATORS

### STUDENT ADVISERS
Every student, after matriculation, is assigned an academic adviser (Level Coordinator) by the Department. Advisers act on behalf of parents and the Department and maintain confidentiality. Students should feel free to consult their advisers on all academic and other persisting problems. If problems cannot be handled by the adviser, students should seek audience with the Head of Department.

## ACADEMIC REGULATIONS AND GRADING FOR MICROBIOLOGY

### ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR MICROBIOLOGY
It is mandatory to attain a **minimum percentage attendance of 75%** in each course of your study programme.

### EXAMINATIONS & ASSESSMENT FOR MICROBIOLOGY
* **Workload:** Students should register for a minimum of **40 credit units** and a maximum of **48 credit units** per session.
* **Continuous Assessment (CA):** Contributes **40%** of the course mark. CA should be measured through term papers, group projects, informal and formal tests, laboratory/field assignments, etc.

### GRADING AND CLASSIFICATION FOR MICROBIOLOGY
| Percentage Score (%) | Letter Grades | Grade Points (GP) | CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) | Class of Degree |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 70 - 100 | A | 5 | 4.50 - 5.00 | 1st Class |
| 60 - 69 | B | 4 | 3.50 - 4.49 | 2nd Class (Upper Division) |
| 50 - 59 | C | 3 | 3.00 - 3.49 | 2nd Class (Lower Division) |
| 45 - 49 | D | 2 | 1.00 - 1.99 | 3rd Class |
| 0 - 44 | F | 0 | 0.00 - 0.99 | Fail |

### GPA/CGPA CALCULATION FOR MICROBIOLOGY
* **Grade Point (GP):** Derived from the actual percentage raw score for a given course.
* **Total Grade Point (TGP):** Sum of all grade points earned by the student in a semester.
* **Total Credits Registered (TCR):** Sum of all credit units registered by the student in a semester.
* **Total Credits Earned (TCE):** Sum of all credit units earned by the student in a semester.
* **CGPA:** Calculated by dividing the Cumulative Total Grade Point (CTGP) by the Cumulative Total Credits Registered (CTCR).

### PROBATION AND WITHDRAWAL FOR MICROBIOLOGY
* **Probation:** A student whose **CGPA falls below 1.00** at the end of a particular year of study earns a period of probation for one academic session.
* **Withdrawal:** A candidate whose CGPA is below **1.00** at the end of a particular period of probation is required to **withdraw** from the University.
* **Repeating Failed Courses:** Students may repeat failed courses provided the total number of credit units registered during that semester does not exceed 24. The Grade Points earned at all attempts shall count towards the CGPA.

### EXAMINATION OFFENCES AND PUNISHMENTS FOR MICROBIOLOGY
| Offence | Punishment |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Leakages** | Immediate expulsion; or results cancelled and student allowed to start afresh from where the offence was committed. Cases must be reported to the police promptly. |
| **Impersonation** | Expulsion from the University. |
| **Unauthorized Exchange of Information** (Collusion, copying, "giraffing") | **1st Offence:** Suspension for the next two semesters and cancellation of the result of the paper(s) involved. **2nd Offence:** Expulsion from the university. |
| **Taking Examination Scripts out of Examination Hall** | Expulsion from the university. |
| **Insult or Assault on Supervisors and Invigilators** | Expulsion from the university; student(s) handed over to the police for prosecution. |
| **Carelessness in the Examination Hall** (e.g., unauthorized materials under desk) | Warning letter to the student(s). |
